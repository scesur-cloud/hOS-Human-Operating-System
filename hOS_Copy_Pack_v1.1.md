### THE PROBLEM (Agitation)

**Header:** Stop trying to "journal" your way out of a kernel panic.

You treat your company like an engineering problem: you track metrics, you optimize code, you manage resources. But when you crash, you treat it like a mystery.

The reality: burnout is not a feeling. It is a predictable stack of failures:

- **Hardware debt:** sleep architecture + sensory gating failures  
- **OS loops:** certainty addiction + impostor patterns consuming your RAM  
- **Output leaks:** busywork disguised as productivity to avoid anxiety  

You don't need "self-care." You need root-cause analysis.

### THE SOLUTION (What you get)

**Header:** The Founder Burnout Protocol (50Q)

A clinical-grade debugging script for high-functioning founders and tech leads. Not generic wellness prompts - structured, self-paced, and surgical.

**The arc:**
- **BLOCK I: START (Hardware) - 10 Questions**  
  Sleep latency, stimulant signatures, shutdown tells.
- **BLOCK II: DEEP (Operating System) - 28 Questions**  
  Identity fusion ("I am my company"), cognitive distortions, relational debt.
- **BLOCK III: ACTION (Output) - 9 Questions**  
  Avoidance loops, busywork identification, recovery deficit.
- **BLOCK IV: CLOSE (Toolkit) - 3 Questions**  
  Agency + resilience inventory.

**Runtime:** 45-60 minutes  
**Output:** one clear bottleneck + one actionable patch

## Conversion Boosters

### MINI-OUTPUT LIST (place after "The Solution")

**Header:** What you will have in 60 minutes:

1) **The Root Cause** - You'll know if your burnout is Biological (hardware debt), Psychological (identity fusion), or Behavioral (avoidance loops).  
2) **The Loop Map** - You'll see the script running your life (e.g., Impostor Fear -> Overcommitment -> Sleep Delay -> Crash).  
3) **The Patch** - One behavior to stop + one resource to activate. No 10-step plans.

### OFFER STACK + PRICE JUSTIFICATION (choose one version)

#### Version A (Logic / Hard)
**Header:** The ROI of $29

- Reusability: run it quarterly as a recalibration
- Cost: coffee money for clarity

#### Version B (Clinical / Authority)
**Header:** Why this isn't just "another PDF"  
- Clinical-grade architecture: Hardware -> OS -> Output sequencing  
- Data-first: facts, numbers, events (not vague feelings)  
- Safety-first: Intensity capped at I2-I3 + Stop Rule  
- Loop isolation: identifies the feedback loop driving the crash

#### Version C (Asset / Soft)
**Header:** Maintenance manual for your most expensive asset  
You monitor servers and debug code - this is uptime monitoring for the machine running it all: you. Investment: $29 (lifetime access + v1.2 updates).

### RISK REVERSAL (Guarantee)

**Header:** The "Do The Work" Guarantee  
This is not a magic pill. It's a work protocol.

- still fail to find a single actionable insight or bottleneck...

Email **[SUPPORT_EMAIL]** and you'll get a refund.  
If you want comfort, buy a scented candle. If you want clarity, buy this.
