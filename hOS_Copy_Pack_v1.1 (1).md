## A) Landing Page Copy (Paid Product) — Founder Burnout Protocol ($29)

### HERO
**Headline:** Debug Your Human Operating System.  
**Sub-headline:** Most founder burnout isn’t a lack of “motivation.” It’s a system error. Run a protocol that locates your bottleneck—**Hardware, OS, Network, or Output**—and generates a patch in **45 minutes**.

**Primary CTA:** **GET THE FOUNDER BURNOUT PROTOCOL ($29)** → [PAID_PROTOCOL_URL]  
*Instant PDF Download • v1.1 • Self-Paced*

### THE PROBLEM (Agitation)
**Header:** Stop trying to “journal” your way out of a kernel panic.

You treat your company like an engineering problem: you track metrics, you optimize code, you manage resources.  
But when **you** crash, you treat it like a mystery.

You wait for a vacation that doesn’t fix it.  
You use caffeine to force-reboot a tired nervous system.  
You download meditation apps you never open.

**Reality:** Burnout is not a feeling. It’s a predictable stack of failures:

- **Hardware Debt:** sleep architecture + sensory gating failures  
- **OS Loops:** “Certainty Addiction” + “Impostor Patterns” consuming your RAM  
- **Output Leaks:** “Busywork” disguised as productivity to avoid anxiety  

You don’t need “self-care.” You need **root-cause analysis**.

---

### THE SOLUTION (What you get)
**Header:** The Founder Burnout Protocol (50Q)

This is a clinical-grade debugging script for high-functioning founders and tech leads.  
Not a generic wellness questionnaire. A **structured 4-block deep-dive** into your source code.

**The Arc**
- **BLOCK I: START (Hardware) — 10 Questions**  
  Target: sleep latency, stimulant signatures, somatic shutdown tells  
- **BLOCK II: DEEP (Operating System) — 28 Questions**  
  Target: identity fusion (“I am my company”), cognitive distortions, relational debt  
- **BLOCK III: ACTION (Output) — 9 Questions**  
  Target: avoidance loops, busywork identification, recovery deficits  
- **BLOCK IV: CLOSE (Toolkit) — 3 Questions**  
  Target: resources you already have to build your patch  

**Runtime:** 45–60 minutes  
**Output:** one clear bottleneck + one actionable patch

---

## MINI-OUTPUT LIST (Insert right here)
**Header:** What you will have in 60 minutes:

1) **The Root Cause**  
You will know definitively if your burnout is primarily **Biological** (Hardware debt), **Psychological** (Identity fusion), or **Behavioral** (Avoidance loops). No more guessing.

2) **The Loop Map**  
You will see the invisible script running your life (e.g., **Impostor Fear → Overcommitment → Sleep Delay → Sensory Overload → Crash**).

3) **The Patch**  
You will leave with **one behavior to stop** and **one resource to activate**. No 10-step plans. Just the one lever that moves the rock.

### OFFER STACK + JUSTIFICATION
**Header:** Why this isn’t just “another PDF.”

- ✅ **Clinical-Grade Architecture:** Built on the hOS 10-Domain Atlas. Respects the hierarchy: **Hardware → OS → Output**  
- ✅ **Data > Story:** Forces answers in facts (hours, counts, events)—not vague feelings  
- ✅ **Safety-First:** Intensity **I2–I3**. Includes Stop Rules + safety checks. No trauma-dumping; just debugging  
- ✅ **Loop Isolation:** Identifies your specific loop (e.g., Anxiety → Busywork → Exhaustion → Stimulants)

**Investment:** **$29**  
(Less than the takeout you ordered because you were too tired to cook.)

## ANTI-PERSONA (Insert before FAQ or before Guarantee)
**Header:** Who this is NOT for.

❌ **Passive Consumers**  
If you collect PDFs but never run the protocol, save your $29. This requires **45 minutes of active, uncomfortable honesty**.

❌ **“Fix Me” Seekers**  
This script doesn’t fix you. It shows you **how to fix the system**. If you want a magic pill without the work, this isn’t it.

❌ **Acute Clinical Crisis**  
If you are unable to function, experiencing panic attacks daily, or self-harming, do not buy this. Seek qualified professional help immediately. This is an educational/coaching tool — **not emergency medicine**.

---

### RISK REVERSAL (Guarantee)
**Header:** The “Do The Work” Guarantee.

This is not a magic pill. It’s a work protocol.

Answer the 50 questions honestly.  
Follow the execution rules (Stop Rule, Data > Story).  
If you do that and still fail to find a single actionable insight or bottleneck… email **[SUPPORT_EMAIL]** for a refund.

No questions asked.

---

### FAQ
**Q: Is this therapy?**  
A: No. This is a structured self-audit. If you are in acute crisis, seek professional medical support.

**Q: Can I do this over a weekend?**  
A: Yes. It’s designed for one 45–60 minute sitting—ideally disconnected from Slack/Email.

**Q: What format is it?**  
A: A high-contrast, print-friendly PDF (v1.1). No fluff, no stock photos. Just the code.

## B) Email Sequence (3 emails)

### Email 1 — “You ran the audit. Here’s the next command.”
**Subject options:**  
- SYSTEM_UPDATE_AVAILABLE  
- Your audit found the bottleneck — here’s the fix  
- You don’t need motivation. You need a patch.

**Body:**  
You ran the System Status Check and identified where the system is strained: Hardware, OS, Network, or Output.  
That’s diagnosis.  
But diagnosis without a patch is just awareness.

The Founder Burnout Protocol isolates:
- biological debt (sleep, stimulants, shutdown tells)  
- OS scripts (certainty addiction, impostor patterns, identity fusion)  
- output loop (busywork → avoidance → anxiety → recovery deficit)

### Email 2 — “The loop most founders don’t see”
**Subject options:**  
- Burnout isn’t tiredness. It’s a loop.  
- Busywork is not productivity.  
- Your nervous system is carrying your strategy.

**Body:**  
Most founders don’t burn out because they work hard.  
They burn out because they unknowingly run the same loop:

Stimulants → Late-night grind → Busywork → Avoidance → Recovery debt → Irritability → More stimulants

This protocol is built to catch the loop at the root.

### Email 3 — “45 minutes. One bottleneck. One patch.”
**Subject options:**  
- 45 minutes. One bottleneck. One patch.  
- If you only do one thing this week…  
- This is cheaper than a crash.

**Body:**  
If you’re thinking “I don’t have time,” that’s usually the signal.

This takes 45–60 minutes.  
And it often saves weeks of low-grade inefficiency.

## D) Gumroad Short Description (1 paragraph)
Most burnout advice is generic. This is structural. The Founder Burnout Protocol is a 50-question debugging script that profiles your Human Operating System—Hardware, OS, Network, Output—and forces one clear bottleneck plus one actionable patch in 45–60 minutes.
